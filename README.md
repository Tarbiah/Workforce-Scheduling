This project centers on the exploration of advanced optimization techniques, specifically the formulation of an Integer Linear Program (ILP) and its subsequent solution using the Branch-and-Bound method.
Scope: A real-world problem of workforce scheduling is being implemented in this project.
Project Description: This code can be used for workforce scheduling in industries where employees need to be assigned to different shifts, taking into account factors such as labor costs, working hoursâ€™ regulations, and the number of employees required for each shift. This optimization problem helps organizations efficiently allocate their workforce while minimizing costs and ensuring that all constraints are satisfied
The project is developed using Python,Flask,HTML&CSS.
